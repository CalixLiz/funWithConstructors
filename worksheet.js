// PART 1

// Write a function maxOfArray() that takes an array of
// numbers as an argument and finds the highest number.


/**
 * PART 2
 *
 * Write a function isVowel() that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1)
 * and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

/**
 * Part 3
 *
 * Define a function reverse() that computes
 * the reversal of a string. For example,
 * reverse("skoob") should return the
 * string "books".

/**
 * Part 4
 *
 * write a function the returns a fizzbuzz string for an input number. 
 A fizzbuzz string is defined as the following:
 For every number from 1 to the input number...
 * - if that number isn't a multiple of 3 or 5, add a period "." to the fizzbuzz string
 * - for every number that is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), add "fizz" to the fizzbuzz string
 * - for every number that is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), add "buzz" to the fizzbuzz string
 * - for every number that is a multiple of 3 and 5, add "fizzbuzz" to the fizzbuzz string
 For example, the fizzbuzz string for the number 3 is "..fizz"
 For the number 15, the fizzbuzz string is "..fizz.buzzfizz..fizzbuzz.fizz..fizzbuzz"
