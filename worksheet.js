// Example

// The purpose of this first exercise is just to show how 
// assertions work and how the homework should be carried out. 
// We'll do it together in class.

// Part EXAMPLE

// Write a function called addOne() that returns the input number, plus one. 

var addOne = function(num) {
	return num + 1
}

// Part 0

// Fix the following code so doubleNum(2) wil equal 4. 

var doubleNum = function(num) {
	num * 2
}

/**
 * PART 1
 *
 * Write a function called sum that takes two numbers as
 * inputs and computes the sum of those two numbers.
 */


// PART 2

// Write a function called average that takes two numbers
// as inputs and returns the average of the two. To avoid
// repeating yourself, use your sum function inside 
// of your average function.


// Part 4

// Write a function called isNegative that will tell 
// whether a number is negative or not.


// Now, modify your sum function again, so that it 
// will return null if any of the inputs is negative.
// To avoid repeating yourself, use your isNegative 
// function inside your sum funciton ***


// Part 5

// Write a function that will find the minimum of four 
// input numbers. You can do it using nested if statements,
// boolean operators, or both (but not neither).


// Part 7

// Using logical operators, write a function that will
// return true if either input is a string, but not 
// both or neither. 


// Part 8

// Write a function called doTwice that takes as input a 
// function and invokes that function twice. 

// For testing purposes, I've included some functions that
// modify global variables, although that's not a good
// pattern for production code.


// Part 9

// Write a function called conditionallyInvoke that takes a function
// as input. It should invoke that input function only if 
// the value of a certain global variable, called ORACLE, is 
// "YES." Otherwise, it will does nothing.


// Part 10

// Make the following assertion work:
	
// Part 11

// Want more?

	
// Part 12

// This can't be healthy...
